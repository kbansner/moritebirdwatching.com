              The island of Seram, part of Wallacea, has unique flora and fauna due to blending of Asian and Australasian species. This island is also known as the home of the Moluccan cockatoo – a bird found nowhere else on earth. Seram Island is now one of the top destinations in Asia for bird watching.

              The villagers in Masihulan, on the northern coast of Seram, are aware of the vital role they play in protecting endangered birds from illegal trading. They are focusing on organizing bird watching tours instead of trapping and smuggling birds.
            p.
              Morite Bird Watching is a small, community-based tour operator located in Masihulan village. All members of the team are native to Seram. With this spirit of community and ecotourism, we’d like to share the rich biodiversity of Seram.

  h3 MORITE, MANUSELA NATIONAL PARK, MASIHULAN

  p In Masihulan, we have a place within the buffer zone of Manusela National Park managed by Morite Bird Watching, an environmental organization focused on conserving animals, forests, and bird nests in old trees. They specialize in protecting parrots, especially cockatoos, which are almost extinct. The organization partners with Manusela National Park Center in conservation efforts.

  p This 20-hectare area features a homestay for visitors who want to enjoy the forest atmosphere. Immerse yourself in the sounds of birds and crickets in the morning and evening. Witness the stunning "spooky" butterflies with their vibrant colors – green, white, black, yellow, and blue.

  p Reaching the location takes just 1 hour and 30 minutes, with two options: (1) a 1-hour trek through the south entrance gate of Manusela National Park; and (2) a 30-minute walk from the Masihulan village community area.

  p Along the way, discover insects, beetles, spiders, wildflowers, medicinal plants, and unique experiences unique to this natural forest with majestic trees. At night, join a local guide to search for nocturnal cuscuses and catch shrimp in the river. Remember to bring a headlamp for these activities if staying overnight.

  p Enjoy your catch for breakfast the next day! If you're interested in seeing cuscuses, guides can mimic their calls to attract them. However, only male cuscuses respond to the calls. Simply observing them is encouraged, while contributing to the organization managing this place is appreciated.

  p Feel free to capture photos or videos! Documentary filming requires a separate budget.

  p Overnight packages are available. Local guides will accompany you during your visit. The homestay offers basic facilities, including buildings, bathrooms, toilets, and water. We prioritize sustainability and use battery lights instead of generators to minimize noise disturbance to animals.
